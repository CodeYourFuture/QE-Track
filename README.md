# Quality Assurance Training

![QA Training](./assets/qa-training.png)

Welcome to the Quality Assurance (QA) Training module! In this repository you'll find everything you need in order to get familiar with the wonderful world of QA.

In order to get the most out of this module you'll need to fulfill a couple of requirements:

- Have some familiarity with software development
- A desire to leave development behind and become a tester

If you have both, you are in the right place!

## Learning goals

In this module you'll get familiar with the fundamentals of QA. By the end of it you have learned:

- What is meant by `working in a QA role`
- The `QA Engineer mindset`
- The many `types of testing`
- What `test cases` are
- How to `identify bugs`
- The importance of `Test-driven development (TDD)` and `Behavior-driven development (BDD)`
- How to `test APIs` using Postman and Newman
