### 1. Value of Testing
Most of us use airplanes and cars. Would you ride in a car or take a seat on an airplane if you knew these vehicles were not tested? Would you feel safe and secure? Itâ€™s human nature to avoid risks if possible. To understand the value of testing you need to what is software testing in the first place .. 

> Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation.

### 2. QA Engineer Mindset
What makes QAs valuable is their mindset! A mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notations held by one or more person. In simple words ... it's the way of thinking. As a QA engineer having the right mindset is the key to ensure quality. 

> A tester's mind should be like that of a child. Someone who is curious, unbiased and not afraid to ask the stupidest of questions .

### 3. Agile Testing
> Agile is a process by which a team can manage a project by breaking it up into several stages and involving constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is key!

As part of the team, QA engineers have important role through the whole process of development. Agile Testing is not sequential (in the sense it's executed only after coding phase) but continuous.
